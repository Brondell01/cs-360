Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The main functions of this application was the required features of a secure login process and a simple inventory management system. Each of these functions was designed to allow a user to easily and quickly understand how to use the application with little to no instruction. A user can now easily maintain an inventory of items on their phone from a secure device that requires a username and password to access. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The UI required multiple different fragments and screens to support the user's expeience and provide an effective application. The main "activities" or screens could be said to be the Log in Screen and the Inventory Management screen. Each of these screens help to summarize the two main functions and contain specific buttons and actions to support their design. Log In would allow users to access a new page to create new accounts, while inventory managment would shuttle users to a screen that allows them to add or edit items on their existing list. This applicaton also makes use of fragments that serve as notificaton pop ups. These help to notify the user on the effectivenss of their actions or the impact they are having on their invnetory. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

This application was designed and built in iterations that allowed me, as a student, to explore and implement new concepts prior to future options being known. This did cause quite a bit of re-work in areas, but the re-work can be seen as streamlined efforts that take advantage of more powerful frameworks or new skills gained throughout the course. Each iteration could be viewed as smaller projects that come together to form a larger more advanced application. This is NOT an ideal process for desiging applications, but did provide an excellent example for how to learn new frameworks and methodologies in my future. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Without unit tests this application was tested primarily under the lense of active user testing and implementation testing. These tests helped to prove base functionality, but required more focused test cases to help test the fridges of expected functions. Overall, the testing helped to hone in the functionality of the application in a way that would make it much more user friendly. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I found myself having to innovate in areas that I ran into challenges dealing with my current skill level. Not having much time to develop this application limited my abilty to focus on becomming an expert, so I would at times reallocate design elements to point toward my innovative solutions from easier to use frameworks or functions. An example being the use of the Room Persistance Library when creating and managing Database entries for this application.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel like the combined behavior of multiple components that work in tandem is the best place to illustrate a competent level of knowldege when working with Android stuido. Being able to create an application that relys on multiple activities, XML layouts, fragments, notification and preferences has been a fun and worthwhile experience.
